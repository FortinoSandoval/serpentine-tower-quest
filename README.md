>**Q: Will you reveal something about Serpentine Tower Quest?**</br></br>
>**Count Tofifti:** Hey, I recently looked that Tower up and it's...  
>**Knightmare (stern look):** SECRET!  
>**Count Tofifti:** Well. Uhm. Yes, probably.  
>**Lionet:** Though I wonder if anyone already had the idea to apply...  
>**Knightmare:** Mind you if I apply a Homer Simpson choke grip on you?  
>**Lionet:** Oh. Uh. I just wanted to...  
>**Knightmare (stern look)**  
>**Lionet (sighs):** ...to shut up and remain silent!  
>**Knightmare:** Splendid! As for an answer... well... how to approach it in a diplomatic way. Let's say: Some places you currently see in the game might play a greater role in an upcoming quest sooner or later. Other places though are just there for flavour. Others again might be part of something that is yet not discovered. As you can't interact in a meaninful way with each object, you can't interact with each theme. If there are quests that are not found yet though, it is unlikely that something about them will be revealed to enforce their discovery, especially it is unlikely such information would be revealed not in game.  
>**Lionet (whispering):** But couldn't you at least tell me if...  
>**Knightmare (smiling sweetly):** But of course I could! (voice becoming menacing) But then I'd have to kill you!  
>**Lionet (laughing nervously):** You are joking right?  
>**Lionet (looking for Count Tofifti):** He's joking, isn't he? Count? COUNT?! Where did he go...?  

##### Conclusions

1. **Knightmare says:** "(...) Some places you currently see in the game might play a greater role in an upcoming quest sooner or later.".
2. According with [TibiaWiki](http://tibia.wikia.com/wiki/Serpentine_Tower_Quest) the **Serpentine Tower** was introduced in the **Update 7.3** (August 11, 2004).
3. That means that they had **6 years** to implement the **Serpentine Tower Quest** with future quests. It is a lot of time!
4. We shouldn't discard that the **Serpentine Tower Quest** it could be still part of a future quest.

>When I was younger, someone told me that the sweaty cyclops Bencthyclthrtrprr would be willing to trade a warlord sword for 100 pieces of iron. Following up on this idea certainly helped me to get into shape but I'm still waiting for that warlord sword. I bet the Basilisk would scare Big Ben into handing it over.  
>This serpent looks so harmless on first glance but its stone gaze strikes terror into the hearts of many. My brave dwarven friends dread that beast even though they managed to trap it with a cave-in. I've tried to break through to it to get rid of the slippery, sneaky creature but to no avail so far. I've even started to search the mines for any of those rumoured Basilisk eggs.
One thing is clear: I cannot allow those renegade dwarfs to gain control over it. I recently overheard some adventurers talking about reaching the Basilisk through Dwacatra, the prison isle. One of them even insisted that the Serpentine Tower holds the key to solving all mysteries at once. But this is a story for another night or day."
